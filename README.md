# NYC Taxi Data Engineering Project


This project demonstrates data engineering fundamentals by cleaning 
and transforming NYC taxi trip data.  It covers essential data 
manipulation steps such as handling missing values, filtering, and 
feature engineering using Python and Pandas.  The goal is to prepare 
the dataset for downstream analysis or machine learning tasks.
